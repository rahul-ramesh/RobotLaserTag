Fault tolerant autonomous robot laser tag game for 18749 CMU
Authors: Rahul Ramesh (rahulram@andrew.cmu.edu), Jacob Nelson (jcnelson@andrew.cmu.edu)

This project demonstrates some of the strategies used to add fault tolerence to an autonomous system, with a range of hardware issues.
We tried to include the aspect of faults into the very fabric of the game, so that the system would inherently be designed to forecast, prevent, and recover from faults.

List of faults we tolerate:
Server Faults
Hardware Faults
Communication Faults
